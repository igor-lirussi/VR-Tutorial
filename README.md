# TemplateRepository
**A tutorial scene where the player can understand the basics of VR interaction, moving, picking objects, teleporting.**
This tutorial is originally designed for HTC Vive.

## Description 
An empty room, with only a table and simple objects. The player hears a voice introduction to moving the head and looking around.

Afterwards the voice explains how to grab the objects and release them, showing the relative button in the controller. 

The tutorial is self-paced, so will proceed only when the player will pick the apple and release it onto the tray.

Finally, the voice will instruct the player how to teleport, showing the relative button and enabling this function. 

At the end of the tutorial is possible to set automatically the passage to another scene. It can be done also on the keyboard using designated keys to go to next scene or start/finish the tutorial.
